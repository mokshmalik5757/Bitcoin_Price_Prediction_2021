# Bitcoin_Price_Prediction_2021
## Price Prediction of Bitcoin Prices for the year 2021.

#### This repository uses various time series models for price prediction of Bitcoin for the year, 2021. I have used many models, from univariate, baseline models like Naive Drift model, Naive Seasonal, to famous, statistical models like SARIMAX, Exponential Smoothing, Theta and 4 Theta models, to regression based models like Linear Regression.

#### I have also used ensemble techniques, for example, Random Forest, Cat Boost, XG Boost, and LGBM Model.

#### I have also used Prophet model from Meta.

#### After this, I have used neural networks for better modeling of various parameters, and using other variables of the dataset as well, thus, treating the dataset as multivariate. 

#### I have used N-BEATS Model, RNN Model, Block RNN Model, Transformer Model, D Linear Model, N Linear Model, Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) Model,Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) Model from the Darts Library.

#### At places, I have used probabilistic version of some models for better results. For example, probabilistic version of RNN Model is equivalent to DeepAR model from Amazon.

#### I have mainly used Darts library for time series analysis, but at places, I have also used pmdarima, prophet and statsforecast libraries as well.
